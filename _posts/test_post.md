This post should display a large hero image at the top of a page.

This post tests a horizontal image using the following YAML Front Matter:

```yaml
image:
  path: /images/_dispatch.png
```

Hero images can also be assigned more succinctly when `thumbnail` or `caption` are not used.

```yaml
image: /images/_dispatch.png
```

Tall images will push content down the page. `1600 x 600` is a good middle-ground size to aim for.
