        I'm a Malware Analyst/Reverse Engineer with 3+ years of experience who currently works at [S21Sec](https://www.s21sec.com/).  I like to participate in CTFs as a hobby, and my team is [Ripp3rs](https://ctftime.org/team/50984).
		In my spare time I go to electronic music festivals like Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival or EDC Las Vegas.
