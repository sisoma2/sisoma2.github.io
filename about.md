        I'm a Malware Analyst/Reverse Engineer with 3+ years of experience who currently works at <a href="https://www.s21sec.com/">S21Sec</a>.  I like to participate in CTFs as a hobby, and my team is <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/50984">Ripp3rs</a>.
		In my spare time I go to electronic music festivals like Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival or EDC Las Vegas.
